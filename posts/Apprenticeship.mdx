## Step 1: Have the Right Designs in Your Portfolio
If you’re looking to become a tattoo apprentice, the **art in your portfolio** is the first thing any mentor will check. At Hull Tattoo Studio, we require **at least 10 fully finished pieces**—this helps us judge your drawing skills, your ability to complete projects, and the overall consistency of your style. It also showcases your understanding of tattoo art. We don’t expect perfection, but we do expect to see that you understand fundamentals such as light sources, shading, line weights, and colour theory.

### Drawing Skills
If you can’t draw a straight line or create smooth shading on paper, you won’t be able to pull it off on human skin. A mentorship at our studio is not here to teach you how to draw; it’s here to teach you how to tattoo. We want to see that you’ve already worked on your drawing fundamentals. So, if your portfolio has wonky lines and poor shading technique, we suggest you work on those areas before applying.

### Presentation
Show us you’re serious by compiling your work in a neat portfolio folder. Avoid disorganised sketches, half-finished designs, or casual phone screenshots. **We want to see 10 strong, finalised pieces** that represent your best work and dedication to the craft. There is little point submitting half-finished or rushed pieces; take your time and truly showcase what you can do.

### Designs People Actually Want
While art is personal, remember that tattooing is also a business. If you’re only drawing things nobody asks for, you’re going to struggle. Clients pay for work that reflects current trends and styles they find meaningful. Show us you’re aware of which designs people actually want.

### Variety
We like seeing diverse styles: black and grey, neo-traditional, blackwork, colour realism, etc. Being adaptable means you can handle any walk-in or custom request. A versatile artist is a more valuable artist.

## Step 2: Have the Right Expectations Before Asking for a Tattoo Apprenticeship
A tattoo apprenticeship often means working **full-time, without pay**, for a year or two. Think of it as “paying your dues”—in our industry, that’s simply how it’s done. Some studios may require an upfront fee, too. While Hull Tattoo Studio does **not** currently charge a mentorship fee, you should be financially prepared for the unpaid period. This can be difficult—many people hold a part-time job alongside a tattoo apprenticeship. Remember, you only start earning when you have paying clients, so the more effort you put into learning—both in the studio and in your spare time—the faster you’re likely to progress.

## Step 3: Research the Right Studios/Mentors in Your Area
If you’re applying to different shops, check that they’re **successful**, do high-quality work, and have a solid reputation. If a shop’s artists aren’t producing good tattoos, there’s little chance you’ll learn strong fundamentals. **Hull Tattoo Studio** prides itself on a high standard of artistry—and we look for dedicated apprentices ready to meet that standard. It’s also important to make sure the studio you’re applying to produces the style you want to learn and that they maintain a high-quality standard of work.

## Step 4: Approach the Tattoo Shops
1. **Research first**: Follow the studio’s social media, check Google reviews, and see what styles they specialise in. An apprenticeship takes a long time, and you’ll be working with these people for quite a while, so it’s worth doing plenty of research.  
2. **Get a tattoo**: Book a small piece at the shop you want to apprentice with to build rapport and get to know how the studio operates.  
3. **Bring your portfolio**: Once you’ve formed a relationship, show us those 10+ completed designs. Mornings are often best. Be humble and take on any feedback you receive.  
4. **Feedback**: If we don’t offer a position on the spot, ask how you can improve. Don’t be afraid of criticism; it can guide your next steps. Try not to get disheartened—there may be many reasons you didn’t get the position.  
5. **Persist**: If you apply and are unsuccessful, adapt and come back. It shows you’re committed and willing to learn.

Even if you don’t land an apprenticeship immediately, demonstrating your passion and progress can open doors later.

## Step 5: The Apprenticeship Itself and Finally Becoming a Tattoo Artist
Congratulations—suppose you’ve landed the apprenticeship! The journey has just begun:

- **Year One**: Expect to do shop tasks like cleaning, greeting clients, running errands, etc. You’ll watch how tattoos are done, but typically won’t tattoo clients for many months.  
- **Year Two**: You’ll likely start tattooing practice skins or yourself, then move on to doing small tattoos on friends or family. As your skills improve, you’ll work on real clients under supervision.

Be aware that progress depends on your mentor’s schedule and your dedication. The more passion you show (e.g., continuously developing your art and technique), the quicker you’ll be entrusted with bigger projects. Especially during the apprentice phase, you’ll be required to use your own initiative to learn and improve when not in the studio. Being a tattoo artist is a self-employed role; you need self-motivation to succeed in this industry.
