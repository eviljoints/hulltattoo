# Tattoo Dos and Don’ts: Your Guide to Inking Right at Hull Tattoo Studio

Getting a tattoo is a big step, and we want to make sure you have the best experience possible at Hull Tattoo Studio. From choosing the right artist to understanding UK laws, here’s your comprehensive guide to inking right.

## Tattoo Dos: Get It Right

### Do Research Your Artist

Your tattoo is a permanent part of you, so it's crucial to choose an artist whose style and work you admire. At Hull Tattoo Studio, our artists specialize in various styles, from realism to bold designs. Check out their portfolios on our [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/hulltattoostudio) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/hull_tattoo_studio) pages to find the perfect match for your vision.

### Do Plan Your Design

Take time to think about what you want. Whether it's a specific image, a phrase, or an abstract design, bring reference pictures or a rough sketch to your consultation. Our artists can help refine your idea into a stunning piece of art.

### Do Follow Aftercare Instructions

Proper aftercare is essential for your tattoo to heal well and look its best. We'll provide you with detailed instructions on how to care for your new ink, including cleaning, moisturizing, and avoiding certain activities. Follow these steps to ensure your tattoo remains vibrant.

### Do Check UK Laws

In the UK, it's illegal to tattoo anyone under 18 years old, even with parental consent. Make sure you're of legal age and bring a valid ID to your appointment. Hull Tattoo Studio is fully registered with Hull City Council, ensuring we meet all legal and safety standards.

### Do Book Smart

We offer multiple ways to book your appointment:
- **In Person**: Visit us at 255 Hedon Road , HU9 1NQ.
- **Social Media**: Message us on Facebook or Instagram with your design ideas.
- **Online**: Use our [booking form](https://www.hulltattoostudio.com/mike) to select your date and time.

For in-person or social media bookings, a £50 deposit is required, which is non-refundable but will be deducted from your total cost. Online bookings require full payment upfront at £400 for a full day.

## Tattoo Don’ts: Avoid the Pitfalls

### Don’t Rush In

Don't make a decision on a whim. Take time to consider your design and make sure it's something you'll love for years to come. Rushing into a tattoo can lead to regret.

### Don’t Skimp on Hygiene

Your health is paramount. Ensure the tattoo studio is clean and that all equipment is sterile. At Hull Tattoo Studio, we prioritize hygiene and use only the highest quality, sterilized tools.

### Don’t Ignore Pain Points

Different parts of the body have different pain levels. Discuss your chosen placement with your artist to understand what to expect. Some areas, like the ribs or feet, can be more painful than others.

### Don’t Haggle Too Hard

Our pricing reflects the skill and time invested in each tattoo. We start at £50, with full-day sessions at £400. We offer flexible payment options, including Klarna, to help manage costs.

### Don’t Skip the Details

When booking, provide as much detail as possible about your desired tattoo—size, style, and placement. This helps us give an accurate quote and ensure we have enough time to complete your piece.

## Choosing Your Next Tattoo: What to Watch For

### Legality

Only get tattooed at a licensed studio. Unlicensed tattooing is illegal and can be dangerous. Hull Tattoo Studio is fully registered and compliant with all regulations.

### Placement

Consider where you want your tattoo. Visible tattoos might affect your professional life, and some areas are more prone to fading or are more painful. Our artists can advise on the best placement for your design.

### Design Longevity

Some designs and placements age better than others. Simple, bold designs often stand the test of time better than intricate details, especially in areas that move a lot or are exposed to the sun.

### Studio Vibes

Visit the studio to get a feel for the environment. It should be clean, welcoming, and professional. Check online reviews to see what others have experienced.
