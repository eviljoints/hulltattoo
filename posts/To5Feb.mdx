# **Top 5 Favourite Tattoos from Hull Tattoo Studio in 2025**

At **Hull Tattoo Studio**, we‚Äôve had an incredible year creating unique and meaningful tattoos for our clients. From cover-ups to bold statement pieces, we love pushing our creativity. Here are our **top five favourite tattoos** from this year, chosen for their **design, placement, and artistic challenge**.

Each tattoo is showcased with a **vibrant neon border** to match our signature cyberpunk aesthetic.

## **1. Trash Polka with a Bright Twist**

One of our absolute favourites this year is this **Trash Polka** tattoo with a **unique, bright twist**. Trash Polka is a style we don‚Äôt get to do often, so it‚Äôs always exciting to break away from the usual designs. This piece combines the classic **bold black and red elements** of Trash Polka with an added **electric blue pop**, making it even more striking.

The mix of **chaotic yet structured elements, abstract patterns**, and **sharp contrasts** really makes this one stand out.

## **2. Owl & Floral Composition**

We love this piece because of its **delicate shading** and overall composition. The **soft, detailed owl** paired with floral elements creates a **beautiful contrast**. The owl‚Äôs natural elegance is reflected in the **smooth transitions of shading**, giving it a **realistic, soft appearance**, while the surrounding flowers add just the right amount of **boldness**.

This tattoo is a great example of how **contrast and composition** bring a design to life.

## **3. Bold Cover-Up with Red Accents**

Cover-ups are always a challenge, but this one turned out **perfectly**. The **strong black lines** provide a **solid foundation**, while the **deep red accents** make the design stand out even more. The placement works especially well with the **flow of the body**, ensuring a seamless transformation from the old tattoo into this **bold new piece**.

We take pride in ensuring that cover-ups **fully mask** the previous tattoo while giving the client something they‚Äôre proud to show off.

## **4. The Purge Mask ‚Äì Neon Perfection**

Bright neon colours? **Yes, please!** This **Purge Mask tattoo** is one of our favourites because of the **sharp contrast** between the **solid black background** and the **electric blue and pink neon glow**. It captures the **cyberpunk aesthetic** perfectly, making it a **true statement piece**.

Neon-style tattoos require an advanced understanding of how light behaves in design, and we love the challenge of making them **look like they‚Äôre glowing** on the skin.

## **5. Seamless Cover-Up with Perfect Placement**

Another **incredible cover-up**, this tattoo stands out because of **how well it fits the body‚Äôs natural shape**. The placement ensures that the **new tattoo looks intentional**, rather than just covering something up. The **flow and detail** of the new design completely conceals the previous work, creating a **fresh and striking piece**.

Cover-ups require skillful planning, and this one came together beautifully.
