# Tattoo Cover-Ups: What’s Possible and What’s Not

Having an old or unwanted tattoo often leads to one of two choices: getting rid of the tattoo entirely or transforming it into something new. Let’s explore both options and focus on the art of cover-ups.

## **Option 1: Laser Removal**

Laser removal is one way to deal with an old tattoo. While it can be quite painful, it allows for cleaner skin that can either stay tattoo-free or serve as a fresh canvas for a new tattoo. However, this post isn’t about laser removal. 

We’re diving into **Option 2: Tattoo Cover-Ups**.

## **What is a Tattoo Cover-Up?**

A tattoo cover-up involves tattooing a new design over an existing one to completely obscure the old tattoo. The goal is to make the original tattoo no longer visible, as though it was never there.

Another method is called **blasting over**. This involves placing a bold new tattoo over the old one without trying to fully hide it. While simpler, parts of the old tattoo will often show through. 

In this post, we’re focusing on **cover-ups** where the aim is complete concealment.

## **Myths and Misconceptions**

A common misconception is that a cover-up tattoo must be at least three times the size of the old tattoo. While this might make the process easier, it’s not always necessary. With careful planning and the right design, a cover-up doesn’t need to be significantly larger than the original.

---

## **Is a Cover-Up More Painful?**

Yes, a cover-up can be slightly more painful. The skin already has micro-scarring from the original tattoo, which makes the process a bit more sensitive. Additionally, the level of discomfort can depend on the tattoo being covered and its location on the body.

## **Common Tattoos We Cover**

Here at **Hull Tattoo Studio**, we specialize in cover-ups and frequently work with:

- **Names and Script Work**: Often chosen impulsively, names and quotes can lose their meaning over time.
- **Old Traditional Tattoos**: These are usually covered due to age-related blurring. However, if we can rework and revitalize them, we’ll gladly do so.

Before committing to a tattoo, especially names or script, think carefully about their long-term significance. You don’t want to end up needing a cover-up down the road.

## **What Makes a Good Cover-Up?**

Not every tattoo can be covered with your first-choice design. The success of a cover-up depends on several factors:

- **Darkness**: How dark is the original tattoo?
- **Distinctive Lines**: Names and script with sharp lines are harder to conceal.
- **Location**: The placement of the tattoo and surrounding space play a role.

For instance, covering a name with a fine-line rose or a pocket watch often won’t work. The old tattoo’s dark lines will show through, leaving you with a watch or rose featuring a visible name. Instead, we need to:

1. **Break Up Distinctive Lines**: Use bold patterns or overlapping elements to disrupt the old design.
2. **Saturate the New Ink**: Highly saturated areas, especially in darker tones, are crucial for proper coverage.
3. **Avoid Negative Space**: Designs with soft shading or open spaces won’t effectively conceal darker ink.

Here’s a video to explain the process in detail, with examples of successful cover-ups:

## **Tattoo Aging and Cover-Ups**

Old tattoos often blur and fade with age. While this can make them easier to cover, it also presents an opportunity to rework and breathe new life into them. Whenever possible, we evaluate whether a tattoo can be enhanced instead of completely covered.
