# What I Wish I Knew

Getting your first tattoo is an exciting leap into the world of ink, but trust us—there are some things you might wish you'd known ahead of time. We’ve gathered a few humorous (and honest) truths that many tattoo newbies learn the hard way. Read on for a fun, eye-opening guide before you commit to that first piece of art!

## 1. That People Like to Touch Them

Surprisingly, tattoos aren’t just admired from afar. When you’re out and about (or a little too relaxed), people can get up close and personal with your ink. Whether it’s rubbing, pinching, or just an overenthusiastic compliment, this uninvited attention can leave you feeling rather molested by unwanted “admiration.”

## 2. Just Because Someone Has a Studio Doesn’t Mean They’re Any Good

Not all tattoo studios are created equal. In Hull and across the UK, pop-up studios seem to be cropping up everywhere—often with very lax licensing standards. This means that even if someone has a studio, they might lack the experience or artistic skill needed for a quality tattoo. Bad tattoos are all too common, and with some unscrupulous shop owners using other artists’ work as their own, it’s a recipe for regret. Stricter licensing laws could save you from ending up with a piece you’re not proud of.

## 3. The Amount of Dirty Looks from the Older Generation

Prepare yourself for the disapproving glares from older generations. It might shock you, but many still associate tattoos with the rebellious past of sailors and “ladies of the night.” Although tattooing today is all about personal expression and embracing who you are, those dirty looks can be a reminder that not everyone is on board with modern trends.

## 4. How Addictive They Are

Tattoos are a lot like a can of Pringles: once you pop, you just can’t stop! The rush of adrenaline and endorphins during a session can quickly turn a single tattoo into an insatiable desire for more. Before you commit to your first piece, ask yourself if you’re ready for a potential tattoo marathon—just be careful not to remortgage your house in the process!

## 5. How Something Doesn’t Stay Cool Forever

Ever noticed how trends change faster than you can say "ink"? That bold American tribal tattoo, once hailed as the epitome of cool, might later leave you wondering if you really wanted that design. It’s a stark reminder to choose tattoos that are meaningful to you rather than following the latest fad or copying what the cool guy down the road got.

## Final Thoughts

There are countless things to consider before getting your first tattoo, and we've practically heard it all. The key is to ask plenty of questions and ensure you're getting exactly what you want—not what your mum, brother, friend, auntie, or best mate Bob insists on. Your tattoo is your personal story, so take your time, do your research, and prepare for some unexpected surprises along the way.

Happy inking!
