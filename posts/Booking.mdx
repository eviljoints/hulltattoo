# How to Book an Appointment at Hull Tattoo Studio

Are you ready for your next tattoo? At **Hull Tattoo Studio**, we offer several booking methods to ensure your experience is as smooth and convenient as possible. Whether you pop into our shop in person or prefer online arrangements, here are all the ways you can schedule your appointment:

---

## 1. Book in Person

The quickest way to **book your tattoo** is to visit our studio at **652 Anlaby Road, HU3 6UU** during our opening hours. This in-person visit allows us to:

- **Discuss** your tattoo idea in detail  
- **Check** the area of the body you’d like tattooed  
- Provide **personalised advice** (particularly useful for cover-ups, since we need to see the existing tattoo in person to assess the best approach)

Having a face-to-face conversation ensures we can allocate the right amount of time and discuss potential design tweaks up front.

## 2. Message Us on Social Media

If you can’t come in straight away, **social media** is the next best option. You’re welcome to message our **shop page** or your chosen artist on Facebook or Instagram. In your message, please include:

- A **detailed description** of what you’d like to get tattooed  
- Any **reference images**, so we can see your vision more clearly  
- An idea of the **size**, **style**, and **body placement** for your tattoo

The more details you provide, the more accurate our **quote** will be, and we can book the correct time slot for your session.

---

## 3. Use Our Online Booking Form

We also have an **online booking form** on each artist’s page, offering you a chance to choose:

- **Date** and **time**  
- **Length** of the appointment

When you book online, you’ll pay **in full** at the time of booking (via card or PayPal). We do recommend **speaking to the artist first** if you’re unsure about how long your tattoo might take. If not enough time is booked, we may not be able to complete your piece in one sitting.

---

## Deposits & Payment Options

- For **in-person** or **social media** bookings, we require a **£50 deposit**. This deposit is **non-refundable** and will be deducted from the total tattoo cost.  
- We now offer **Klarna payments** in-store or through social media conversations. In the near future, Klarna will also be available for our online bookings.
